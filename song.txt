If I say I don't need anyone, I can say these things to you
'Cause I can turn on anyone just like I've turned on you
I've got a tongue like a razor, a sweet switchblade knife
And I can do you favors
Âut then you'll do whatever I like

Here I am, and you're a Rocket Queen
Each night while I'm sleeping oh, so lonely
I share your love in dreams that once were true
